# Convolution-Neural-Networks
This Project is based on image classification using the CNN .
Here we classify the given dataset into cat of dog.The dataset includes 8000 images of both cats and dogs in the training set.
In the test set we have 2000 images of cats and dogs. After training of the dataset we now consider a single image to classify 
it into a cat or dog.
